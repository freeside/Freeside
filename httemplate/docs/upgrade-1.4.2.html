<h1>Upgrading to 1.4.2 from 1.4.1</h1>
<ul>
  <li>If migrating from less than 1.4.1, see these <a href="upgrade9.html">instructions</a> first.
  <li>Back  up your data and current Freeside installation.
  <li>Install <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Locale-SubCountry">Locale::SubCountry</a>
  <li>Install <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=IPC-ShareLite">IPC::ShareLite</a>
  <li>CGI.pm minimum version 2.47 is required.  You will probably need to install a current CGI.pm from CPAN if you are using Perl 5.005 or earlier.
  <li>Run <code>make aspdocs</code> or <code>make masondocs</code>.
  <li>Copy <code>aspdocs/</code> or <code>masondocs/</code> to your web server's document space.
  <li>Run <code>make install-perl-modules</code>.
  <li>The signup server and password server are deprecated in 1.4.2.  Their functionality has been incorperated into the self-service server.  Edit or reinstall your init script appropriately, and set the "signup_server-default_agentnum" and "signup_server-default_refnum" configuration options appropriately.  The FS::SignupClient interface is still available as a compatibility wrapper.  You should be able to continue to use your current signup.cgi.
  <li>Optional: To use typeset invoices, install tetex and ghostscript, and copy conf/invoice_latex, conf/invoice_latexnotes, and conf/invoice_latexfooter to /usr/local/etc/freeside/conf.<datasrc>/
  <li>Restart Apache and freeside-queued.
