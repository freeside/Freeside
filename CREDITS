Thanks to Matt Simerson <matt@michweb.net> of MichWeb Inc. for documentation
and pre-release testing.  Without his help the documentation in 1.0.0
release would have consisted of a single screenfull of text.
(To clear up some misunderstanding, Matt did not write the current
documentation.)

Steve Cleff <cleff@yahoo.com> did the default background image in 1.0.x and
is also the creator of Freeside's elusive mascot, Snakeman, who we hope will
make an appearance in an upcoming version.

1.0.x and most of 1.1.x.

logo for later 1.1.x versions until 1.4.1

Brian McCane? <bmccane@maxbaud.net> contributed PostgreSQL support, HTML
style enhancements and many, many bugfixes.

His changes will hopefully be included in an upcoming version.

following features:
  - Multiple, separate databases and configurations on one box.
