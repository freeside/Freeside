This module implements an OO-interface to database schemas.  Using this module,
you can create a database schema with an OO Perl interface.  You can read the
schema from an existing database.  You can save the schema to disk and restore
it from different process.  Most importantly, DBIx::DBSchema can write SQL
CREATE statements for different databases from a single source.

Currently supported databases are MySQL, PostgreSQL and Sybase.
DBIx::DBSchema will attempt to use generic SQL syntax for other databases.
Assistance adding support for other databases is welcomed.  See the
DBIx::DBSchema::DBD manpage, "Driver Writer's Guide and Base Class".

To install:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test # nothing substantial yet
	make install

Documentation will then be available via `man DBIx::DBSchema' or
`perldoc DBIx::DBSchema'.
