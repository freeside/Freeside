IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS:
---------------------

Please send comments and bug-reports to <dbd-general@gborg.postgresql.org>

Please include the output of perl -v and perl -V, the version of PostgreSQL,
the version of DBD-Pg, the version of DBI, and details about your platform
in your bug-report.


REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

	build, test, and install Perl 5         (at least 5.005)
	build, test, and install the DBI module (at least 1.30)
	build, test, and install PostgreSQL     (at least 7.3)
        build, test, and install Test::Simple   (at least 0.17)

INSTALLATION:
-------------

By default Makefile.PL uses App:Info to find the location of the
PostgreSQL library and include directories.  However, if you want to
control it yourself, define the environment variables POSTGRES_INCLUDE
and POSTGRES_LIB, or POSTGRES_HOME.

	1.   perl Makefile.PL
	2.   make
	3.   make test
	4.   make install

Do steps 1 to 3 as normal user, not as root!


TESTING:
--------

The tests are designed to connect to a live database.  The following
environment variables must be set for the tests to run:

        DBI_DSN=dbi:Pg:dbname=<database>
        DBI_USER=<username>
        DBI_PASS=<password>

If you are using the shared library libpq.so check if your dynamic
loader  finds libpq.so. With Linux the command /sbin/ldconfig -v should
tell you,  where it finds libpq.so. If ldconfig does not find libpq.so,
either add an  appropriate entry to /etc/ld.so.conf and re-run ldconfig
or add the path to  the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

A typical error message resulting from not finding libpq.so is: 

	install_driver(Pg) failed: Can't load './blib/arch/auto/DBD/Pg/Pg.so' 
	for module DBD::Pg: File not found at 

If you get an error message like:

	perl: error while loading shared libraries:
	/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0/i386-linux/auto/DBD/Pg/Pg.so: undefined
	symbol: PQconnectdb

when you call DBI->connect, then your libpq.so was probably not seen at
build-time. This should have caused 'make test' to fail; did you really
run it and look at the output? Check the setting of POSTGRES_LIB and
recompile DBD-Pg.
 
Some linux distributions have incomplete perl installations. If you have
compile errors like "XS_VERSION_BOOTCHECK undeclared", do:

	find .../lib/perl5 -name XSUB.h -print

If this file is not present, you need to recompile and re-install perl.

SGI users: if you get segmentation faults make sure, you use the malloc
which  comes with perl when compiling perl (the default is not to).

HP users: if you get error messages like:

	can't open shared library: .../lib/libpq.sl
	No such file or directory

when running the test script, try to replace the  'shared' option in the
LDDFLAGS with 'archive'. Dan Lauterbach <danla@dimensional.com>


FreeBSD users: if you get during make test the error message:

	'DBD driver has not implemented the AutoCommit attribute'

recompile the DBI module and the DBD-Pg module and disable optimization.
This error message is due to the broken optimization in gcc-2.7.2.1.

If you get compiler errors like:
       In function `XS_DBD__Pg__dr_discon_all_'
    `sv_yes' undeclared (first use in this function)

It may be because there is a 'patchlevel.h' file from another package 
(such as 'hdf') in your POSTGRES_INCLUDE dir.  The presence of this file 
prevents the compiler from finding the perl include file 
'mach/CORE/patchlevel.h'.  Do 'pg_config --includedir' to identify the 
POSTGRES_INCLUDE dir.  Rename patchlevel.h whilst you build DBD::Pg. 


Sun Users: if you get compile errors like:

	/usr/include/string.h:57: parse error before `]'

then you need to remove from pgsql/include/libpq-fe.h the define for
strerror, which clashes with the definition in the standard include
file.

Win32 Users: Running DBD-Pg scripts on Win32 needs some configuration work
on the server side:

	o add a postgres user with the same name as the NT-User 
	  (eg Administrator)
	o make sure, that your pg_hba.conf on the server is configured,
	  such that a connection from another host will be accepted
