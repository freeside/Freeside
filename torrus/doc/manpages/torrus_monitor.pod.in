=head1 NAME

monitor - Torrus Monitor.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<torrus monitor> --tree=I<TREENAME> [I<options...>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command starts the Monitor process for the tree I<TREENAME>. By
default it forks into a daemon, sets the log output file to
F<@logdir@/monitor.TREENAME.log>, performs one monitoring cycle, and
sleeps until the next cycle is scheduled. In daemon mode the log file
can be reopened by sending it a SIGHUP signal.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<--nodaemon>

Prevents the process from becoming a daemon and sets the log to STDERR.

=item B<--runonce>

Instructs the script to run once and exit. Implies B<--nodaemon>.

=item B<--delay=N>

Makes the daemon sleep for N minutes before starting the first cycle.
This would happen on the daemon startup and also after each configuration
recompilation.
For example, when monitor and collector start simultaneously, the collector
needs some time to retrieve the data being monitored.

=item B<--debug>

Sets the log level to debug.

=item B<--verbose>

Sets the debug level to info.

=item B<--help>

Displays a help message.
