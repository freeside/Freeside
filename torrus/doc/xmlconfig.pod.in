=head1 Torrus XML Configuration Guide

=head2 Common rules

The Torrus configuration consists of several XML files.
Once the XML configuration is changed, it must
be compiled into the database by executing C<torrus compilexml>.
In addition, when I<Renderer>, I<Collector> and I<Monitor> processes
notice the configuration changes, they refresh their information automatically.

The top-level XML element is always C<E<lt>configurationE<gt>>, with
sub-elements defining various sections, like datasources or views:

  <configuration>

    <!-- Optional inclusion of other XML files -->
    <include filename="myconfig.xml"/>

    <datasources>
      <!-- Data sources tree definition -->
      ...
    </datasources>
    <views>
      <!-- View definitions -->
      ...
    </views>
    <token-sets>
      <!-- Token sets definitions ->
      ...
    </token-sets>
    <monitors>
      <!-- Monitor definitions ->
      ...
    </monitors>
  </configuration>

Multiple XML files are interpreted in additive matter, i.e.
C<E<lt>datasourcesE<gt>> section from one file is concatenated with
the corresponding sections of previous files. If the same
parameter is defined for the same subtree in several input files,
the last processed value gets into the configuration.

Additional XML files may be added to the compilation list by means of
C<E<lt>includeE<gt>> statement. They will be processed recursively
before the content of the XML file they are referenced from.
The argument C<filename> determines the
name of the file in standard XML files directory.
It is safe to include the same file several times,
Torrus compiler guarantees that files are only processed once.

Some kinds of sections, like C<E<lt>datasourcesE<gt>>, allow to
define the same elements two or more times. In this case,
the previous parameter values are overridden by the new values.

Each component of the configuration is defined by the set of I<parameters>.
They are specified in a common manner, differentiating in parameter names only:

  <view name="default-rrd-html">
    <param name="view-type"     value="html" />
    <param name="expires"       value="300" />
    <param name="html-template" value="default-rrd.html" />
  </view>

The parameter value can be specified either by C<value> XML attribute,
or by the text contents of the C<E<lt>paramE<gt>> element.

Some parameter values require other parameters to be defined, like in the
above example: a view of type C<html> cannot exist without a template.

After I<all> XML files are compiled, the parameters are checked for validity
by the compiler.

=head2 Character sets

By default, all XML input is treated as UTF-8 (unicode). This is important
because all the HTML output generated by Torrus is encoded UTF-8.

However, you may use Latin1 (ISO-8859-1) encoding in your XML files.
In order to ensure correct displaying of non-ASCII characters,
the encoding must be specified in your XML files:

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>

You need this only in those files containing non-ASCII characters
in Latin1 encoding.

In addition, version C<1.54_3> or higher of C<XML::LibXML> is required, and
Torrus version 0.0.16 or above.


=head2 Macros

In the top level of the configuration tree, a number of macros may be defined.
Currently they are used in C<snmp-object> parameter only.
Macros are specified with C<E<lt>defE<gt>> elements, being the direct
children of C<E<lt>definitionsE<gt>> element:

  <configuration>
    <definitions>
      <!-- IF-MIB:ifTable  -->
      <def name="ifDescr"           value="1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2" />
      <def name="ifPhysAddress"     value="1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.6" />
      <def name="ifInOctets"        value="1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.10" />
      <def name="ifInUcastPkts"     value="1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.11" />
      <def name="ifInErrors"        value="1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.14" />
      <def name="ifOutOctets"       value="1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.16" />
      <def name="ifOutUcastPkts"    value="1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.17" />
      <def name="ifOutErrors"       value="1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.20" />

      <!-- Default Interface index lookup -->
      <def name="IFIDX"         value="M($ifDescr, %interface-name%)" />
    </definitions>
    ...

These definitions are global across all XML configuration files,
and are referenced with dollar sign and the definition name, e.g.:

    <leaf name="ifInErrors">
      <param name="snmp-object" value="$ifInErrors.$IFIDX" />
      ...


=head2 Parameter properties

Some parameters require special handling during the compilation or
at the runtime. The parameter properties define such behaviour in the
XML configuration.

Currently two properties are recognized: "remspace" and "expand".

  <configuration>
    <param-properties>
      <!-- Parameters where space is removed from values -->
      <prop param="action"             prop="remspace" value="1"/>
      <prop param="display-rpn-expr"   prop="remspace" value="1"/>
      <prop param="ds-names"           prop="remspace" value="1"/>
      ...
    </param-properties>



=head2 Datasource definitions

Datasources are organized into a tree hierarchy. All parameters are inherited
by the subtrees and leafs from their parents, and can be overridden on
lower levels.

The datasources tree consists of two key types of components:
I<subtree> and I<leaf>. A subtree can have child subtrees or leaves.
A leaf can never have children. A subtree represents logical aggregation,
while the leaf always represends the actual datasource.

In XML configuration, a child subtree or leaf belongs to the parent
element, like the following:

  <datasources>
    <!-- This is the first child of the tree root -->
    <subtree name="Netflow">
      <param name="ds-type" value="rrd-file" />
      <param name="comment"
             value="Netfow data collected by FlowScan with CarrierIn.pm" />
      <!-- All Flowscan-generated files reside here -->
      <param name="data-dir" value="/var/local/flowscan/graphs" />
      <subtree name="Exporters">
        <param name="comment" value="Netflow exporting devices" />
        ...
        <!-- all exporters defined here -->
      </subtree>
       ...
      <subtree name="Total">
        <param name="data-file" value="total.rrd" />
        <leaf name="bps">
          <param name="comment" value="Bits per second" />
          <param name="leaf-type" value="rrd-def" />
          <param name="rrd-ds" value="bits" />
          <param name="rrd-cf" value="AVERAGE" />
        </leaf>
        <leaf name="pps">
          <param name="comment" value="Packets per second" />
          <param name="leaf-type" value="rrd-def" />
          <param name="rrd-ds" value="pkts" />
          <param name="rrd-cf" value="AVERAGE" />
        </leaf>
        <leaf name="packlen">
          <param name="comment" value="Average packet length in bytes" />
          <param name="leaf-type" value="rrd-cdef" />
          <param name="rpn-expr" value="{bps},8,/,{pps},/" />
        </leaf>
      </subtree>
    </subtree>
  </datasources>


Each subtree or a leaf is identified by a I<path>, the symbolic
notation similar to filesystem paths. In any path notation,
subtree names always end with slash (/), and this trailing slash is
the part of the name. In this case, any subtree is identified by a path
ending with slash, while leaf paths always end with a word symbol.
The top-level subtree is identified by a single slash.

The other components of the datasouce definition are I<templates> and
I<aliases>.

=head3 Templates

A template is used when it's needed to define multiple different pieces of
the configuration in the same way. For instance, the definition for
input/output octets and bits can be specified once in a template,
and then applied where appropriate.

The piece of XML configuration inside the C<E<lt>templateE<gt>>
element is memorized under the template name, and reproduced
in every occurrence of C<E<lt>apply-templateE<gt>> with the corresponding
template name. The template definition must be the direct child
element of C<E<lt>configurationE<gt>> XML element:

  <datasources>
    <!-- Default views must be defined -->
    <param name="default-subtree-view" value="default-dir-html" />
    <param name="default-leaf-view" value="default-rrd-html" />

    <!-- Many of our RRDs have the field "bits" - let's define it here -->
    <template name="bps">
      <leaf name="bps">
        <param name="comment" value="Bits per second" />
        <param name="leaf-type" value="rrd-def" />
        <param name="rrd-ds" value="bits" />
        <param name="rrd-cf" value="AVERAGE" />
      </leaf>
    </template>
    ...
      <subtree name="Total">
        <param name="data-file" value="total.rrd" />
        <apply-template name="bps" />
        <leaf name="pps">
          <param name="comment" value="Packets per second" />
          <param name="leaf-type" value="rrd-def" />
          <param name="rrd-ds" value="pkts" />
          <param name="rrd-cf" value="AVERAGE" />
        </leaf>
        <leaf name="packlen">
          <param name="comment" value="Average packet length in bytes" />
          <param name="leaf-type" value="rrd-cdef" />
          <param name="rpn-expr" value="bps,8,/,pps,/" />
        </leaf>
      </subtree>


=head3 Aliases

Alias is the alternative symbolic name for a subtree or a leaf.
It can be even a name from a different subtree hierarchy.
If that alternative hierarchy does not exist, the corresponding
subtrees are created:

  <subtree name="62.3.44.55">
    <alias>/Netflow/ExportersByName/rtrTelehouse1/</alias>
    ...

=head3 Compile-time variables

Compile-time variables are those defined somewhere in datasource hierarchy,
and valid within a given subtree and its children. It is possible to define
pieces of XML configuration which are or are not compiled, depending on the
value of corresponding variable.

Variables are set by C<setvar> XML element, with mandatory attributes
C<name> and C<value>. 

Variable values are used in C<iftrue> and C<iffalse> XML elements.
Mandatory parameter C<var> specifies the variable name. The child XML elements
are compiled if the variable value is true or false, correspondingly.
A true value is C<true> or a nonzero number. Undefined variable is identified
as false.

Example:

  <template name="cisco-cbqos-classmap-meters">
  ...
    <iftrue var="CiscoIOS_cbQoS::CMNoBufDrop">
      <leaf name="Dropped_No_Buffer">
      ...
      </leaf>
    </iftrue>
  </template>

  <subtree name="QoS_Stats">
    <setvar name="CiscoIOS_cbQoS::CMNoBufDrop" value="true"/>
    ....
  </subtree>
  

=head3 Parameter value substitution

For any given leaf, some parameters may reference the other parameter values,
by embracing the parameter name with percent signs:

   <param name="data-file" value="%snmp-host%_hostaverages.rrd" />

The parameter substitution is performed at runtime. The substitution formula
may be defined at a higher subtree level, and the substitution itself will
occur at leaf level.

The parameter substitution is performed only to those paraneters
which are defined with the property "expand".

=head3 Common parameters

=over 4

=item * C<ds-type>

Mandatory parameter for every datasource leaf. Currently, the following values
are recongized:

=over 8

=item * C<rrd-file>

The datasource is an RRD file generated by some external collector.
Implies mandatory parameters: C<data-dir>, C<data-file>, C<leaf-type>.

=item * C<collector>

The datasource is generated by Torrus Collector.
Implies mandatory parameters: C<collector-type>, C<storage-type>,
C<collector-period>, C<collector-timeoffset>.

=item * C<rrd-multigraph>

This leaf is dedicated to displaying of multiple
other datasources in one graph. It cannot be referenced for any
other purpose, because there's no numeric value associated with it.

=back

=item * C<nodeid>

Optional. If defined, it should contain a unique string identifying
this particular leaf or subtree.


=item * C<node-display-name>

Optional. If defined, it overrides the subtree or leaf name for displaying.
The subtree and leaf names are not allowed to have spaces and special
characters, and this parameter helps to display strings as they are, such as
router interface names.


=item * C<comment>

Optional. This is a string of text which is displayed when browsing through
the tree.

=item * C<help-text>

Optional. This parameter is not inherited by child nodes. If defined,
the user is offered a I<Help> shortcut in the given subtree or view.
It allows to open a new window with the help text displayed, together with
the current path. Some simple markup is allowed in the text, in a format
of Template-Toolkit tool:
C<[%em('some text')%]> would be displayed in italics, and
C<[%strong('some text')%]> would be bold.

=item * C<monitor>

Optional. Comma-separated list of monitor names (spaces are allowed) that
must be run upon periodic runs of monitor module (see I<Monitor definitions>
section of this manual). Monitor schedule parameters must be defined
for the monitor to run properly: C<monitor-period> and C<monitor-timeoffset>.

=item * C<monitor-period>, C<monitor-timeoffset>

Mandatory parameters for leaves that have C<monitor> defined.
They define the monitor schedule for each individual datasource.
The time for execution is determined by formula:

   time + period - (time mod period) + timeoffset

=item * C<monitor-vars>

Required if one or more monitors requires the variables. In monitor's
RPN expressions, the variables are referenced as C<#varname>. These
variables are looked up in the leaf's C<monitor-vars> parameter.
The syntax of this parameter is semicolon-delimited C<name=value> pairs:

  <param name="monitor-vars" value="min=300000;max=1000000"/>

=item * C<monitor-action-target>

Optional. Specifies a reference to an alternative leaf which will be used
for the monitor action. For example, you might need to see a multigraph
leaf in the tokenset instead of one single datasource.

=item * C<precedence>

Optional. Default value: C<0>. When rendering, the subtree listing is
sorted according to precedence and alphabetic order of names.
The higher the precedence, the closer to the top of the list
the child node is displayed.

=item * C<legend>

Optional. If given, produces a short listing at the top of the HTML output,
with tabulated values. Format: C<Category1:Value1; Category2:Value2...>.
Spaces around the delimiters are ignored.

Example:

  <subtree name="rtrZurich1">
    <param name="legend">
      Location:Zurich;
      Contact: John Smith;
      Telephone: 01 9911299
    </param>

=item * C<graph-title>

A horizontal string at the top of the graph.

=item * C<graph-legend>

Optional. This legend text is printed inside the graph explaining
the line color.

=item * C<vertical-label>

Optional. Text to print along Y axsis on the graph.

=item * C<graph-lower-limit>, C<graph-upper-limit>

Optional. Fix the upper and lower boundaries of the graph.

=item * C<graph-rigid-boundaries>

Optional. When set to "yes", the graph will not expand if the value is outside
the lower or upper limit.

=item * C<rrd-scaling-base>

Optional. Valid values are: "1000" and "1024". Default: "1000".
Determines the base for kilo-, mega-, and giga- scaling factor.
Normally it should be 1000 for traffic counters, and 1024 for memory
or storage sizes.

=item * C<graph-logarithmic>

Optional. When set to "yes", the graph is drawn in logarithmic y-axis scale.

=item * C<line-style>, C<line-color>

These optional parameters override the corresponding ones from the view
definition.

=item * C<default-subtree-view>, C<default-leaf-view>

Mandatory. Determine the default view for a leaf or subtree, correspondingly.
See I<View definitions> section of this manual.

=item * C<rrgraph-views>

Mandatory. Defines 5 views to display the graphs. Must contain 5
comma-delimited view names for short-period, daily, weekly, monthly,
and yearly view.

=item * C<tokenset-member>

Optional. Adds this leaf or this subtree child leaves to the specified
token sets. Tokenset names are comma-separated, and must be defined in
C<E<lt>token-setsE<gt>> part of configuration.

=item * C<descriptive-nickname>

Optional. If defined, it is used in tokenset members listing as a member
identifier, instead of the leaf path.

=item * C<hidden>

Optional. Valid values: C<yes>, C<no>.
When set to C<yes>, the leaf or subtree is not
displayed in the subtree listing,
unless C<SHOWHIDDEN> option is true. When C<SHOWHIDDEN> is enabled,
the node name and comment are shown in italics.

=item * C<has-overview-shortcuts>, C<overview-shortcuts>,
C<overview-subleave-name-X>, C<overview-shortcut-text-X>,
C<overview-shortcut-title-X>, C<overview-page-title-X>,
C<overview-direct-link-X>, C<overview-direct-link-view-X>

When C<has-overview-shortcuts> is set to C<yes> on a subtree level,
default HTML templates expect the five parameters to be set.
C<overview-shortcuts> is a comma-separated list of shortcut names,
and for each name "X", C<overview-subleave-name-X> defines the
current subtree's grandchild leaves name which would compose the overview page.
When C<overview-direct-link-X> is set to C<yes>, the URL under the
graph will point to the direct child subtree, and
C<overview-direct-link-view-X> will define the view for that subtree.
Usually this view would be C<expanded-dir-html>.

=item * C<ignore-lower-limit>, C<ignore-upper-limit>, C<ignore-limits>

Optional. When set to C<yes>, they make the renderer ignore
C<graph-lower-limit>, C<graph-upper-limit>, or both, accordingly.
In addition, C<ignore-limits> disables the C<graph-rigid-boundaries>
parameter.

=item * C<graph-ignore-decorations>

Optional. When set to C<yes>, the view C<decorations> are ignored.

=item * C<graph-disable-gprint>

Optional. When set to C<yes>, the view parameter C<gprint-values> and other
GPRINT-related parameters are ignored.

=item * C<hrule-legend-I<name>>

Optional. If a horizontal rule with the given name is defined, this parameter
specifies the legend to be printed.

=item * C<searchable>

Optional. If set to C<yes>, the corresponding subtree or leaf is included
in the search database.

=item * C<collector-instance>

Mandatiry. The parameter defines the collector instance number.
This parameter is automatically calculated by the configuration compiler.

=item * C<transform-value>

transformation. The keyword C<DOLLAR> is replaced with the dollar sign ($),
and C<MOD> is replaced with the percent sign (%).
The initial value is supplied in C<$_>, which should be referenced as
C<DOLLAR_> in your Perl code.
The code should return a numeric value or C<U> for an undefined
value. The returned value is then passed to the storage.
The parameter substititions are performed on the value of the
parameter, therefore it should not contain the percent(%) and dollar ($) signs.

=item * C<value-map>

Optional. Collector may return values which need translation into
numbers. This parameter defines the mapping for such values. The
parameter value is a comma-separated list of C<value:number> pairs.


=item * C<collector-scale>

Optional. Specifies the translation RPN formula for the data before
being passed to RRD database. Implicitly the datasource value is appended
to the left of the given RPN. I<Warning:> the translation works I<before>
the RRDtool processes the data, so it makes sence to scale only non-COUNTER
values.

=item * C<snmp-ipversion>

Mandatory for C<collector-type=snmp>. Valid values are C<4> and C<6>. The
parameter defines the IP protocol version. If C<snmp-host> contains a DNS
name, the IP address is determined by looking up A or AAAA DNS records,
according to IP version.

=item * C<snmp-transport>

Mandatory for C<collector-type=snmp>. Valid values are C<tcp> and C<udp>.


=item * C<snmp-host>

Mandatory when C<collector-type=snmp>. Specifies the hostname or IP address
of the SNMP agent.

=item * C<snmp-port>

Mandatory when C<collector-type=snmp>. Specifies the UDP port of the
SNMP agent.

=item * C<domain-name>

Optional DNS domain name. If given, and if C<snmp-host> does not contain
dot symbol (.), this domain name is appended to C<snmp-host>.

=item * C<snmp-localaddr> and C<snmp-localport>

Optional parameters specifying the local socket binding address and port.

=item * C<snmp-version>

Mandatory when C<collector-type=snmp>. Specifies the SNMP version for the
given device. Valid values are: C<1>, C<2c>, C<3>.

=item * C<snmp-community>

Mandatory when C<collector-type=snmp> and SNMP version is
C<1> or C<2c>. Specifies the SNMP community for the given device.

=item * C<snmp-username>

Mandatory when C<collector-type=snmp> and SNMP version is C<3>.

=item * C<snmp-authkey>

Optional authentication key for SNMPv3. If not defined, the authentication
level is set to C<noAuthNoPriv>. If only C<snmp-authkey> or
C<snmp-authpassword> are specified, the security level is set to
C<authNoPriv>. The security level is set to C<authPriv> if either
of C<snmp-privkey> or C<snmp-privpassword> is defined.

=item * C<snmp-authpassword>

Optional authentication password for SNMPv3. See notes for C<snmp-authkey>
parameter.

=item * C<snmp-authprotocol>

Optional authentication protocol for SNMPv3. Valid values: C<md5> or C<sha>.
Default is C<md5>.

=item * C<snmp-privkey>

Optional privacy key for SNMPv3. If defined, C<snmp-authkey> or
C<snmp-authpassword> must be defined too.

=item * C<snmp-privpassword>

Optional privacy password for SNMPv3. If defined, C<snmp-authkey> or
C<snmp-authpassword> must be defined too.

=item * C<snmp-privprotocol>

Optional privacy protocol for SNMPv3. Valid values: C<des>, C<aes128cfb>,
or C<3desede>. Default is C<des>.

=item * C<snmp-timeout>

in seconds.

=item * C<snmp-retries>

Mandatory when C<collector-type=snmp>. Specifies the SNMP session retry count.

=item * C<snmp-oids-per-pdu>

Mandatory when C<collector-type=snmp>. Specifies the number of SNMP OIDs per
one UDP packet.

=item * C<snmp-object>

Mandatory when C<collector-type=snmp>. Specifies the SNMP OID to be polled
from the agent. The object must return a single numeric value.

In order to reference the dynamic instances, i.e. interface counters,
two mapping types are supported: reverse mapping and variable value
substitution.

Reverse mapping has syntax as follows:

  M(baseoid, string)

The result of reverse mapping is the tail of the OID which has the head
C<baseoid> and whose value equals the string.

Variable value substitution is defined by syntax:

  V(oid)

The returned value must be a numeric value which is substituted in place
of this expression.

=item * C<snmp-object-type>

Optional. Supported values: C<COUNTER64>, C<OTHER>. When set to C<COUNTER64>,
the SNMP variable value is treated as 64-bit integer. Not using this
parameter may lead to loss of precision.

=item * C<snmp-check-sysuptime>

Optional. Default value: C<yes>. When set to C<no>, the collector does not
query C<SNMPv2-MIB::sysUpTime> (C<1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0>). By default,
the uptime counter is used to detect if the agent was rebooted between
the collector cycles. In this case the dynamic maps for the given host
are automatically rebuilt. This parameter is needed for compatibility
with some non-standard agents which don't implement this OID.

=item * C<snmp-max-msg-size>

Optional. If defined, it sets the SNMP maximum message size different from
default 1472 octets (true for UDP/IPv4, see Net::SNMP documentation for more
information).

C<endOfMibView> are ignored, and no action is performed when such errors
occur.

=item * C<system-id>

Mandatory for every collector type.
Default value for SNMP collector: C<%snmp-host%>.
Unique identifier of the host.
This parameter is used in various template definitions for
C<data-file>, C<descriptive-nickname> and C<collector-timeoffset-hashstring>.

=item * C<rpn-expr>

Mandatory when C<collector-type=cdef>. The RPN defines an arithmetic expression
that is used to create a new datasource from several other ones. For example,
it may define the sum of traffic on several different interfaces.

=item * C<cdef-collector-delay>

Mandatory when C<collector-type=cdef>. Defines the delay time in collector
periods. The collector will read the data from the RPN datasources with the
specified delay from the current time. F<cdef-collector-defs.xml> sets
the default value to 0.

=item * C<cdef-collector-tolerance>

Mandatory when C<collector-type=cdef>. Delay time in collector periods that
the collector accepts when no recent data is available.
F<cdef-collector-defs.xml> sets the default value to 2.

=back


=head3 RRD-Multigraph leaves

The leaves with C<ds-type=rrd-multigraph> are dedicated for
displaying of several datasource values in one graph.
Such leaves cannot be referenced for a numerical value, hence
cannot be monitored.

Example:

  <subtree name="SampleMulti">
    <leaf name="sample1">
      <param name="ds-type" value="rrd-multigraph" />
      <param name="ds-names" value="in,out" />
      <param name="foobarpath"
             value="/SNMP/Routers/213.230.38.4/FastEthernet0_0" />

equivalent to solid colour. Value C<7F> gives 50% transparency which should
be suitable for most applications.

=item * C<ignore-views-X>

Optional comma-separated list of view names. The graph for this DS name
will not be drawn in the views specified. The validator does not check
it, so it's up to you to guarantee that at least one DS is always displayed
in a multigraph.

Optional. When set to C<yes>, this datasource is not included in GPRINT output.

=back

=head2 View definitions

In our context, I<view> means any kind of object representation.
The same subtree or view can be displayed in different ways and in
different formats: HTML, graph image, plain text, etc.

I<Renderer> module handles these view definitions. For any subtree
or leaf, it renders the specified view, and keeps the cache of rendered
files.

Each subtree or leaf must have a default view. This is controlled by
two parameters that may be defined in the root subtree:
C<default-subtree-view> and C<default-leaf-view>.

The set of views is flat, though they can inherit the parameters
one from another. Each view is referenced by its name, and is
defined by the set of parameters. Same way as with datasources,
certain parameter values imply the neccessaty to define certain other
parameters:

  <views>
    <view name="default-rrgraph">
      <param name="view-type"     value="rrgraph" />
      <param name="expires"       value="300" />
      <param name="width"         value="500" />
      <param name="height"        value="250" />
      <param name="width-hint"    value="580" />
      <param name="line-style"    value="##SingleGraph" />
      <param name="line-color"    value="##SingleGraph" />

      <!-- Daily graph, inherits parameters from the above -->
      <view name="last24h">
        <param name="start"         value="-24h" />
      </view>

      <!-- Weekly graph -->
      <view name="lastweek">
        <param name="start"         value="-7d" />
      </view>
    </view>
  </views>

Currently the view is defined by the configuration only.
Probably, in the future additional parameters will be supplied dynamically.

I<Monitor> is a named set of parameters that defines the behaviour
of monitor module. Each leaf can be given a number of monitors
via C<monitor> parameter.

Upon monitor module run, an I<action> is launched if the alarm conditions
of a given monitor are satisfied.

  <monitors>
    <!-- First define the actions -->

    <!-- This action will put the graphs of alarmed datasources in
         a single alarm report page -->
    <action name="graph-hw-failures">

      <param name="rpn-expr" value="100,1024,1024,*,*,GT" />
      <param name="action" value="graph-jumps" />
      <param name="expires" value="3600" />
      <param name="comment"
             value="Traffic is higher than 10 mbps" />
    </monitor>
  </monitors>

=head3 Event types

Should the alarm condition occur, a series of events is happening
in sequentional order:

=over 4

=item * C<set>

This event type occurs the first time the alarm condition is met.

=item * C<repeat>

This event type means that the alarm condition still persists
after the previous run of Monitor.

=item * C<clear>

Event of this type happens when the alarm condition stops.

=item * C<forget>

Once the alarm is cleared, this event happens after the expiration
time of the monitor.

=back

=head3 Monitor parameters

=over 4

=item * C<monitor-type>

Mandatory parameter. Specifies the monitor type. The following monitor
types are recognized:

=over 8

=item * C<failures>

Triggers the action when Holt-Winters FAILURES function gives value of 1.
This requires RRDtool verion 1.1.x and aberrant behaviour parameters
defined for te given RRD file.

=item * C<expression>

Triggers the action when given RPN expression returns nonzero.
See I<RPN expressions in Torrus> manual for more details.
This monitor type implies that the RPN expression is specified in
C<rpn-expr> parameter. The current leaf value is prepended to the given RPN.

=back

=item * C<rpn-expr>

Mandatory for monitor type C<expression>. Defines the RPN expression to
evaluate. The current leaf value is prepended to the given RPN.
The expresion may reference leaf-dependent variables: the
constructs of the form C<#varname> are replaced with the variable
value specified in the leaf's C<monitor-vars> parameter.

=item * C<action>

Mandatory parameter, comma-separated list of action names (spaces
are allowed). Each action is triggered when the alarm condition is met.

=item * C<expires>

Mandatory parameter, the number of seconds of expiration period.
After the alarm condition becomes false, this parameter determines
the time of memorizing the event in monitor status reports.

=item * C<comment>

Optional but recommended parameter, specifies the string identifying
the event that this monitor watches.

=item * C<severity>

Optional severity level. Used for the action type C<exec>.

=item * C<display-rpn-expr>

Optional RPN expression for transforming the datasource value.
If defined, it will be applied to the value before setting
C<TORRUS_VALUE> and C<TORRUS_DISPLAY_VALUE> environment variables.

=item * C<display-format>

Optional I<sprintf> format for displaying the value in
C<TORRUS_DISPLAY_VALUE> environment variable. Default is C<%.2f>.

=head3 Action parameters

=over 4

=item * C<action-type>

Mandatory parameter, defines the type of action. Recognized
values are:

=over 8

=item * C<tset>

When this type of action is triggered, the leaf is added to the specified
tokenset (see I<Token sets definitions> section in this manual).
The leaf persists in the tokenset until the event of type C<forget>.
This action type implies the parameter C<tset-name>.

=item * C<exec>

This action type defines an external program to launch. Two other parameters
determinate its behaviour: mandatory C<command> and optional C<launch-when>.

=back

=item * C<tset-name>

Mandatory for action type C<tset>. Defines the tokenset name
where the leaf is added when the monitor condition is met.

=item * C<command>

Mandatory for action type C<exec>. Defines the external program to launch.
The following strings are substituted in the parameter value:

=over 8

=item * C<E<amp>gt;>

Relaced with C<E<gt>>.

=item * C<E<amp>lt;>

Relaced with C<E<lt>>.

=back

The following environment variables are passed to the child process:

=over 8

=item * C<$TORRUS_HOME>

C<prefix> where Torrus was installed.

=item * C<$TORRUS_BIN>

Directory containing Torrus executables.

=item * C<$TORRUS_UPTIME>

Number of seconds since Monitor has started.

=item * C<$TORRUS_TREE>, C<$TORRUS_TOKEN>, C<$TORRUS_NODEPATH>

Tree name, token and pathname of the leaf causing the alarm.

=item * C<$TORRUS_NCOMMENT>, C<$TORRUS_NPCOMMENT>

C<comment> parameter of the node and its parent.
Empty if the parameter is not defined for the given leaf.

=item * C<$TORRUS_EVENT>

Event type.

=item * C<$TORRUS_MONITOR>

Monitor name

=item * C<$TORRUS_MCOMMENT>

Monitor's C<comment> parameter value.

=item * C<$TORRUS_TSTAMP>

Timestamp (in seconds since Epoch) of the event.

=item * C<$TORRUS_VALUE>

For expression monitor type, this returns the last read value of the
datasource, possibly transformed by C<display-rpn-expr> expression.

=item * C<$TORRUS_DISPLAY_VALUE>

For expression monitor type, it contains a human-readable form
of the value, possibly transformed by C<display-rpn-expr> expression.

=item * C<$TORRUS_SEVERITY>

If the C<severity> parameter is defined in the monitor, its value
is passed with this variable.

=back

=item * C<launch-when>

Optional for action type C<exec>. The comma-separated list of event
types when the given action should be launched. If not defined,
the event type C<set> is used by default.

=item * C<setenv-params>

Optional for action type C<exec>. The comma-separated list of leaf parameters
which would be passed as environment variables to the child process.
The environment variables are of the form C<$TORRUS_P_paramname>. Hyphens ('-')
are replaced with underscores ('_') in the parameter names.

=item * C<setenv-dataexpr>

Optional for action type C<exec>. Comma-separated list of C<ENV=paramname>
pairs. C<ENV> defines the environment variable name: it is prefixed with
C<Torrus_>. C<paramname> defines the action parameter name. This parameter
is interpreted as RPN expression applied to the current leaf being monitored.
The result of this RPN expression is passed to the action script
in the environment variable.

Example:

  <action name="report-temperature">
      <param name="action-type" value="exec" />

      <!-- This is our proprietary reporting script -->
      <param name="command">
        /usr/local/bin/report_temperature
      </param>
      <param name="launch-when" value="set" />

      <!-- We want to tell the action script the actual values
           of the "temperature" and "humidity" leaves in the current
           datasource tree -->
      <param name="setenv-dataexpr" value="TEMP=expr-temp, HMD=expr-hmd" />
      <param name="expr-temp" value="{temperature(LAST)}" />
      <param name="expr-hmd" value="{humidity(LAST)}" />

      <!-- We also want to tell the action script the parameter "monitor-vars"
           which was configured for the current leaf. -->
      <param name="setenv-params" value="monitor-vars" />
  </action>
