=head1 NAME

freeside-wipe-cvv - Wipe sensitive payment information from customer records.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  freeside-wipe-cvv [ -v ] [ -n ] [ -d days ] user

=head1 DESCRIPTION

freeside-wipe-cvv deletes the CVV numbers (and, optionally, credit
card or bank account numbers) of customers who have no non-canceled 
packages.  Normally CVV numbers are deleted as soon as a payment is 
processed; if the customer is canceled before a payment is processed, 
this may not happen and the CVV will remain indefinitely, violating 
good security practice and (possibly) your merchant agreement.
Running freeside-wipe-cvv will remove this data.

-v: Be verbose.

-n: Remove card and account numbers in addition to CVV numbers.  This 
will also set the customer's payment method to 'BILL'.

-d days: Only remove CVV/card numbers from customers who have been 
inactive for at least that many days.  Optional; will default to 
all canceled customers.
