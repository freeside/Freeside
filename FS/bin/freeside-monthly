=head1 NAME

freeside-monthly - Run monthly billing and invoice collection events.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  freeside-monthly [ -d 'date' ] [ -y days ] [ -p 'payby' ] [ -a agentnum ] [ -s ] [ -v ] user [ custnum custnum ... ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Bills customers and runs invoice collection events, for the alternate monthly
event chain.  If you have defined monthly event checks, should be run from
crontab monthly.

Bills customers.  Searches for customers who are due for billing and calls
the bill and collect methods of a cust_main object.  See L<FS::cust_main>.

  -d: Pretend it's 'date'.  Date is in any format Date::Parse is happy with,
      but be careful.

  -y: In addition to -d, which specifies an absolute date, the -y switch
      specifies an offset, in days.  For example, "-y 15" would increment the
      "pretend date" 15 days from whatever was specified by the -d switch
      (or now, if no -d switch was given).

  -p: Only process customers with the specified payby (CARD, DCRD, CHEK, DCHK, BILL, COMP, LECB)

  -a: Only process customers with the specified agentnum

  -s: re-charge setup fees

  -v: enable debugging

user: From the mapsecrets file - see config.html from the base documentation

custnum: if one or more customer numbers are specified, only bills those
customers.  Otherwise, bills all customers.

=head1 NOTE

In most cases, you would use freeside-daily only and not freeside-monthly.
freeside-monthly would only be used in cases where you have events that can
only be run once each month, for example, batching invoices to a third-party
print/mail provider.
