=head1 NAME

freeside-sqlradius-seconds - Command line time-online tool

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  freeside-sqlradius-seconds freeside_username target_username start_date [ stop_date ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Returns the number of seconds the specified username has been online between
start_date (inclusive) and stop_date (exclusive).
See L<FS::svc_acct/seconds_since_sqlradacct>

B<freeside_username> is a username added by freeside-adduser.
B<target_username> is the username of the user account to query.
B<start_date> and B<stop_date> are in any format Date::Parse is happy with.
B<stop_date> defaults to now if not specified.

=head1 BUGS

Selection of the account in question is rather simplistic in that
B<target_username> doesn't necessarily identify a unique account (and wouldn't
even if a domain was specified), and no sqlradius export is checked for.
