FS::part_fee - Object methods for part_fee records

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use FS::part_fee;

  $record = new FS::part_fee \%hash;
  $record = new FS::part_fee { 'column' => 'value' };

  $error = $record->insert;

  $error = $new_record->replace($old_record);

  $error = $record->delete;

  $error = $record->check;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An FS::part_fee object represents the definition of a fee

Fees are like packages, but instead of being ordered and then billed on a 
cycle, they are created by the operation of events and added to a single
invoice.  The fee definition specifies the fee's description, how the amount
is calculated (a flat fee or a percentage of the customer's balance), and 
how to classify the fee for tax and reporting purposes.

FS::part_fee inherits from FS::Record.  The following fields are currently 
supported:

=over 4

=item feepart - primary key

=item comment - a description of the fee for employee use, not shown on 
the invoice

=item disabled - 'Y' if the fee is disabled

=item classnum - the L<FS::pkg_class> that the fee belongs to, for reporting

=item taxable - 'Y' if this fee should be considered a taxable sale.  
Currently, taxable fees will be treated like they exist at the customer's
default service location.

=item taxclass - the tax class the fee belongs to, as a string, for the 
internal tax system

=item taxproductnum - the tax product family the fee belongs to, for the 
external tax system in use, if any

=item pay_weight - Weight (relative to credit_weight and other package/fee 
definitions) that controls payment application to specific line items.

=item credit_weight - Weight that controls credit application to specific
line items.

=item agentnum - the agent (L<FS::agent>) who uses this fee definition.

=item amount - the flat fee to charge, as a decimal amount

=item percent - the percentage of the base to charge (out of 100).  If both
this and "amount" are specified, the fee will be the sum of the two.

=item basis - the method for calculating the base: currently one of "charged",
"owed", or null.

=item minimum - the minimum fee that should be charged

=item maximum - the maximum fee that should be charged

=item limit_credit - 'Y' to set the maximum fee at the customer's credit 
balance, if any.

=item setuprecur - whether the fee should be classified as 'setup' or 
'recur', for reporting purposes.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item new HASHREF

Creates a new fee definition.  To add the record to the database, see 
L<"insert">.

=cut

sub table { 'part_fee'; }

=item insert

Adds this record to the database.  If there is an error, returns the error,
otherwise returns false.

=item delete

Delete this record from the database.

=item replace OLD_RECORD

Replaces the OLD_RECORD with this one in the database.  If there is an error,
returns the error, otherwise returns false.

=item check

Checks all fields to make sure this is a valid example.  If there is
an error, returns the error, otherwise returns false.  Called by the insert
and replace methods.

=item lineitem INVOICE

Given INVOICE (an L<FS::cust_bill>), returns an L<FS::cust_bill_pkg> object 
representing the invoice line item for the fee, with linked 
L<FS::cust_bill_pkg_fee> record(s) allocating the fee to the invoice or 
its line items, as appropriate.

If the fee is going to be charged on the upcoming invoice (credit card 
processing fees, postal invoice fees), INVOICE should be an uninserted
L<FS::cust_bill> object where the 'cust_bill_pkg' property is an arrayref
of the non-fee line items that will appear on the invoice.
