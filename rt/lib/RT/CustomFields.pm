  RT::CustomFields - a collection of RT CustomField objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use RT::CustomFields;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 METHODS



=cut

  # By default, order by SortOrder
  $self->OrderByCols(
	 { ALIAS => 'main',
	   FIELD => 'SortOrder',
	   ORDER => 'ASC' },

     );

=head2 LimitToLookupType

Takes LookupType and limits collection.

=cut

sub LimitToLookupType  {
    my $self = shift;
    my $lookup = shift;

    $self->Limit( FIELD => 'LookupType', VALUE => "$lookup" );
}

=head2 LimitToChildType

Takes partial LookupType and limits collection to records
where LookupType is equal or ends with the value.

=cut

sub LimitToChildType  {
    my $self = shift;
    my $lookup = shift;

    $self->Limit( FIELD => 'LookupType', VALUE => "$lookup" );
    $self->Limit( FIELD => 'LookupType', ENDSWITH => "$lookup" );
}


=head2 LimitToParentType

Takes partial LookupType and limits collection to records
where LookupType is equal or starts with the value.

=cut

sub LimitToParentType  {
    my $self = shift;
    my $lookup = shift;

    $self->Limit( FIELD => 'LookupType', VALUE => "$lookup" );
    $self->Limit( FIELD => 'LookupType', STARTSWITH => "$lookup" );
}

=head2 LimitToObjectId

Takes an ObjectId and limits the collection to CFs applied to said object.

When called multiple times the ObjectId limits are joined with OR.

=cut

sub LimitToObjectId {
    my $self = shift;
    my $id = shift;
    $self->Limit(
        ALIAS           => $self->_OCFAlias,
        FIELD           => 'ObjectId',
        OPERATOR        => '=',
        VALUE           => $id || 0,
        ENTRYAGGREGATOR => 'OR'
    );
}

=head2 LimitToGlobalOrObjectId

Takes list of object IDs and limits collection to custom
fields that are applied to these objects or globally.

=cut

sub LimitToGlobalOrObjectId {
    my $self = shift;
    my $global_only = 1;


    foreach my $id (@_) {
        $self->LimitToObjectId($id);
        $global_only = 0 if $id;
    }

    my $self = shift;
    my @ids = @_;

    my $ocfs_alias = $self->_OCFAlias( New => 1, Left => 1 );
    if ( @ids ) {
        # XXX: we need different EA in join clause, but DBIx::SB
        # doesn't support them, use IN (X) instead
        my $dbh = $self->_Handle->dbh;
        $self->Limit(
            LEFTJOIN   => $ocfs_alias,
            ALIAS      => $ocfs_alias,
            FIELD      => 'ObjectId',
            OPERATOR   => 'IN',
            QUOTEVALUE => 0,
            VALUE      => "(". join( ',', map $dbh->quote($_), @ids ) .")",
        );
    }

    return $ocfs_alias;
}

=head2 LimitToNotApplied

Takes either list of object ids or nothing. Limits collection
to custom fields to listed objects or any corespondingly. Use
zero to mean global.

=cut

sub LimitToNotApplied {
    my $self = shift;
    my @ids = @_;

    my $ocfs_alias = $self->_LimitToOCFs(@ids);

    $self->Limit(
        ENTRYAGGREGATOR => 'AND',
        ALIAS    => $ocfs_alias,
        FIELD    => 'id',
        OPERATOR => 'IS',
        VALUE    => 'NULL',
    );
}

=head2 LimitToApplied

Limits collection to custom fields to listed objects or any corespondingly. Use
zero to mean global.

=cut

sub LimitToApplied {
    my $self = shift;
    my @ids = @_;

    my $ocfs_alias = $self->_LimitToOCFs(@ids);

    $self->Limit(
        ENTRYAGGREGATOR => 'AND',
        ALIAS    => $ocfs_alias,
        FIELD    => 'id',
        OPERATOR => 'IS NOT',
        VALUE    => 'NULL',
    );
}

=head2 LimitToGlobalOrQueue QUEUEID

DEPRECATED since CFs are applicable not only to tickets these days.

Limits the set of custom fields found to global custom fields or those tied to the queue with ID QUEUEID

=cut

sub LimitToGlobalOrQueue {
    my $self = shift;
    my $queue = shift;
    $self->LimitToGlobalOrObjectId( $queue );
    $self->LimitToLookupType( 'RT::Queue-RT::Ticket' );
}


=head2 LimitToQueue QUEUEID

DEPRECATED since CFs are applicable not only to tickets these days.

Takes a queue id (numerical) as its only argument. Makes sure that
Scopes it pulls out apply to this queue (or another that you've selected with
another call to this method

=cut

sub LimitToQueue  {
   my $self = shift;
  my $queue = shift;

  $self->Limit (ALIAS => $self->_OCFAlias,
                ENTRYAGGREGATOR => 'OR',
		FIELD => 'ObjectId',
		VALUE => "$queue")
      if defined $queue;
  $self->LimitToLookupType( 'RT::Queue-RT::Ticket' );
}


=head2 LimitToGlobal

DEPRECATED since CFs are applicable not only to tickets these days.

Makes sure that Scopes it pulls out apply to all queues
(or another that you've selected with
another call to this method or LimitToQueue)

=cut

sub LimitToGlobal  {
   my $self = shift;

  $self->Limit (ALIAS => $self->_OCFAlias,
                ENTRYAGGREGATOR => 'OR',
		FIELD => 'ObjectId',
		VALUE => 0);
  $self->LimitToLookupType( 'RT::Queue-RT::Ticket' );
}


=head2 ApplySortOrder

Sort custom fields according to thier order application to objects. It's
expected that collection contains only records of one
L<RT::CustomField/LookupType> and applied to one object or globally
(L</LimitToGlobalOrObjectId>), otherwise sorting makes no sense.

=cut

sub ApplySortOrder {
    my $self = shift;
    my $order = shift || 'ASC';
    $self->OrderByCols( {
        ALIAS => $self->_OCFAlias,
        FIELD => 'SortOrder',
        ORDER => $order,
    } );
}


=head2 ContextObject

Returns context object for this collection of custom fields,
but only if it's defined.

=cut

sub ContextObject {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->{'context_object'};
}


=head2 SetContextObject

Sets context object for this collection of custom fields.

=cut

sub SetContextObject {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->{'context_object'} = shift;
}


sub _OCFAlias {
    my $self = shift;
    my %args = ( New => 0, Left => 0, @_ );

    return $self->{'_sql_ocfalias'} if $self->{'_sql_ocfalias'} && !$args{'New'};

    my $alias = $self->Join(
        $args{'Left'} ? (TYPE => 'LEFT') : (),
        ALIAS1 => 'main',
        FIELD1 => 'id',
        TABLE2 => 'ObjectCustomFields',
        FIELD2 => 'CustomField'
    );
    return $alias if $args{'New'};
    return $self->{'_sql_ocfalias'} = $alias;
}


=head2 Next

Returns the next custom field that this user can see.

=cut

sub Next {
    my $self = shift;

    my $CF = $self->SUPER::Next();
    return $CF unless $CF;

    $CF->SetContextObject( $self->ContextObject );

    return $self->Next unless $CF->CurrentUserHasRight('SeeCustomField');
    return $CF;
}

=head2 NewItem

Returns an empty new RT::CustomField item
Overrides <RT::SearchBuilder/NewItem> to make sure </ContextObject>
is inherited.

=cut

sub NewItem {
    my $self = shift;
    my $res = RT::CustomField->new($self->CurrentUser);
    $res->SetContextObject($self->ContextObject);
    return $res;
}
