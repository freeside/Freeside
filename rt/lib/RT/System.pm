=head1 NAME 

RT::System

=head1 DESCRIPTION

RT::System is a simple global object used as a focal point for things
that are system-wide.

It works sort of like an RT::Record, except it's really a single object that has
an id of "1" when instantiated.

This gets used by the ACL system so that you can have rights for the scope "RT::System"

In the future, there will probably be other API goodness encapsulated here.

=cut


package RT::System;

use strict;
use warnings;

use base qw/RT::Record/;

use RT::ACL;

# System rights are rights granted to the whole system
# XXX TODO Can't localize these outside of having an object around.
our $RIGHTS = {
    SuperUser              => 'Do anything and everything',           # loc_pair
    AdminUsers     => 'Create, modify and delete users',              # loc_pair
    ModifySelf     => "Modify one's own RT account",                  # loc_pair
    ShowConfigTab => "Show Configuration tab",     # loc_pair
    ShowApprovalsTab => "Show Approvals tab",     # loc_pair
    ShowGlobalTemplates => "Show global templates",     # loc_pair
    LoadSavedSearch => "Allow loading of saved searches",     # loc_pair
    CreateSavedSearch => "Allow creation of saved searches",      # loc_pair
    ExecuteCode => "Allow writing Perl code in templates, scrips, etc", # loc_pair
};

our $RIGHT_CATEGORIES = {
    SuperUser              => 'Admin',
    AdminUsers             => 'Admin',

=head2 AvailableRights

Returns a hash of available rights for this object.
The keys are the right names and the values are a
description of what the rights do.

This method as well returns rights of other RT objects,
like L<RT::Queue> or L<RT::Group>. To allow users to apply
those rights globally.

=cut

    delete $rights{ExecuteCode} if RT->Config->Get('DisallowExecuteCode');

    return(\%rights);
}

=head2 RightCategories

Returns a hashref where the keys are rights for this type of object and the
values are the category (General, Staff, Admin) the right falls into.

=cut

sub RightCategories {
    my $self = shift;

    my $queue = RT::Queue->new(RT->SystemUser);
    my $group = RT::Group->new(RT->SystemUser);

    my %rights = (%{$RIGHT_CATEGORIES}, %{$gr}, %{$qr}, %{$cr}, %{$clr});

    return(\%rights);
}

=head2 AddRights C<RIGHT>, C<DESCRIPTION> [, ...]

Adds the given rights to the list of possible rights.  This method
should be called during server startup, not at runtime.

=cut

sub AddRights {
    my $self = shift if ref $_[0] or $_[0] eq __PACKAGE__;
    my %new = @_;
    $RIGHTS = { %$RIGHTS, %new };
    %RT::ACE::LOWERCASERIGHTNAMES = ( %RT::ACE::LOWERCASERIGHTNAMES,
                                      map { lc($_) => $_ } keys %new);
}

=head2 AddRightCategories C<RIGHT>, C<CATEGORY> [, ...]

Adds the given right and category pairs to the list of right categories.  This
method should be called during server startup, not at runtime.

=cut

sub AddRightCategories {
    my $self = shift if ref $_[0] or $_[0] eq __PACKAGE__;
    my %new = @_;
    $RIGHT_CATEGORIES = { %$RIGHT_CATEGORIES, %new };
}

sub _Init {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->SUPER::_Init (@_) if @_ && $_[0];
}

=head2 id

Returns RT::System's id. It's 1. 

=cut

*Id = \&id;
sub id { return 1 }

=head2 Load

Since this object is pretending to be an RT::Record, we need a load method.
It does nothing

=cut

sub Load    { return 1 }
sub Name    { return 'RT System' }
sub __Set   { return 0 }
sub __Value { return 0 }
sub Create  { return 0 }
sub Delete  { return 0 }

    my $self = shift;
    my $queue = shift;

    use Carp;
    confess "SubjectTag called on $self with $queue" if $queue;

    return $queue->SubjectTag if $queue;

    my $queues = RT::Queues->new( $self->CurrentUser );
    $queues->Limit( FIELD => 'SubjectTag', OPERATOR => 'IS NOT', VALUE => 'NULL' );
    return $queues->DistinctFieldValues('SubjectTag');
}

=head2 QueueCacheNeedsUpdate ( 1 )

Attribute to decide when SelectQueue needs to flush the list of queues
and retrieve new ones.  Set when queues are created, enabled/disabled
and on certain acl changes.  Should also better understand group management.

If passed a true value, will update the attribute to be the current time.

=cut

sub QueueCacheNeedsUpdate {
    my $self = shift;
    my $update = shift;

    if ($update) {
        return $self->SetAttribute(Name => 'QueueCacheNeedsUpdate', Content => time);
    } else {
        my $cache = $self->FirstAttribute('QueueCacheNeedsUpdate');
        return (defined $cache ? $cache->Content : 0 );
    }
