__PACKAGE__->AddRights(%$RIGHTS);
__PACKAGE__->AddRightCategories(%$RIGHT_CATEGORIES);

=head2 AddRights C<RIGHT>, C<DESCRIPTION> [, ...]

Adds the given rights to the list of possible rights.  This method
should be called during server startup, not at runtime.

=cut

sub AddRights {
    my $self = shift;
    my %new = @_;
    $RIGHTS = { %$RIGHTS, %new };

=head2 RightCategories

Returns a hashref where the keys are rights for this type of object and the
values are the category (General, Staff, Admin) the right falls into.

=cut

sub RightCategories {
    return $RIGHT_CATEGORIES;
}

=head2 AddRightCategories C<RIGHT>, C<CATEGORY> [, ...]

Adds the given right and category pairs to the list of right categories.  This
method should be called during server startup, not at runtime.

=cut

sub AddRightCategories {
    my $self = shift if ref $_[0] or $_[0] eq __PACKAGE__;
    my %new = @_;
    $RIGHT_CATEGORIES = { %$RIGHT_CATEGORIES, %new };
}



=head2 SelfDescription

Returns a user-readable description of what this group is for and what it's named.

=cut

	my $self = shift;
	if ($self->Domain eq 'ACLEquivalence') {

}



=head2 Load ID

Load a group object from the database. Takes a single argument.
If the argument is numerical, load by the column 'id'. Otherwise, 
complain and return.

=cut

sub Load {
    my $self       = shift;
    my $identifier = shift || return undef;

    if ( $identifier !~ /\D/ ) {
        $self->SUPER::LoadById($identifier);
    }
    else {
        $RT::Logger->crit("Group -> Load called with a bogus argument");
        return undef;
    }
}



=head2 LoadUserDefinedGroup NAME

Loads a system group from the database. The only argument is
the group's name.


=cut

sub LoadUserDefinedGroup {
    my $self       = shift;
    my $identifier = shift;

    if ( $identifier =~ /^\d+$/ ) {

            Name   => $identifier,
        );
    }
}



=head2 LoadACLEquivalenceGroup PRINCIPAL

Loads a user's acl equivalence group. Takes a principal object or its ID.
ACL equivalnce groups are used to simplify the acl system. Each user
has one group that only he is a member of. Rights granted to the user
are actually granted to that group. This greatly simplifies ACL checks.
While this results in a somewhat more complex setup when creating users
and granting ACLs, it _greatly_ simplifies acl checks.

=cut

    my $self = shift;

Loads a Pseudo group from the database. The only argument is
the group's name.


=cut

sub LoadSystemInternalGroup {
    my $self       = shift;
    my $identifier = shift;

    return $self->LoadByCols(
        Domain => 'SystemInternal',
        Type   => $identifier,
    );

=head2 LoadTicketRoleGroup  { Ticket => TICKET_ID, Type => TYPE }

Loads a ticket group from the database. 

Takes a param hash with 2 parameters:

    Ticket is the TicketId we're curious about
    Type is the type of Group we're trying to load: 
        Requestor, Cc, AdminCc, Owner

=cut

                           );

=head2 LoadQueueRoleGroup  { Queue => Queue_ID, Type => TYPE }

Takes a param hash with 2 parameters:

                           );
}



=head2 LoadSystemRoleGroup  Type

Loads a System group from the database. 

Takes a single param: Type

    Type is the type of Group we're trying to load: 
        Requestor, Cc, AdminCc, Owner

                           );

=head2 Create

You need to specify what sort of group you're creating by calling one of the other
Create_____ routines.

=cut

    # is a member of the principal the rights have been granted too

A helper subroutine which creates a group containing only

=head2 CreateRoleGroup { Domain => DOMAIN, Type =>  TYPE, Instance => ID }

A helper subroutine which creates a  ticket group. (What RT 2.0 called Ticket watchers)
Type is one of ( "Requestor" || "Cc" || "AdminCc" || "Owner") 
Domain is one of (RT::Ticket-Role || RT::Queue-Role || RT::System-Role)
Instance is the id of the ticket or queue in question

This routine expects to be called from {Ticket||Queue}->CreateTicketGroups _inside of a transaction_

Returns a tuple of (Id, Message).  If id is 0, the create failed

=head2 SetDisabled BOOL

If passed a positive value, this group will be disabled. No rights it commutes or grants will be honored.
It will not appear in most group listings.

This routine finds all the cached group members that are members of this group  (recursively) and disables them.
