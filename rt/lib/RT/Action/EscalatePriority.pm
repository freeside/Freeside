  RT::Action::EscalatePriority

=head1 DESCRIPTION

EscalatePriority is a ScripAction which is NOT intended to be called
per transaction. It's intended to be called by an RT escalation tool.
One such tool is called rt-crontool and is located in $RTHOME/bin (see
C<rt-crontool -h> for more details)

EsclatePriority uses the following formula to change a ticket's priority:

    Priority = Priority +  (( FinalPriority - Priority ) / ( DueDate-Today))

Unless the duedate is past, in which case priority gets bumped straight
to final priority.

In this way, priority is either increased or decreased toward the final priority
as the ticket heads toward its due date.

Alternately, if you don't set a due date, the Priority will be incremented by 1
until it reaches the Final Priority.  If a ticket without a due date has a Priority
greater than Final Priority, it will be decremented by 1.
